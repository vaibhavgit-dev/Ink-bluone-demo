      "Pariksith Singh, MD, is a practicing physician of 30 years. Board Certified in Internal Medicine, he believes unsettling changes in the healthcare industry can also be transformative. “For me it is a time for remarkable opportunity, growth, and innovation,” he says. “I can look back at what I have accomplished, but also look forward in eager anticipation at what is possible.” Dr. Singh watched his organization, Access Health Care Physicians, LLC, grow from a simple, multi-service provider in 2001 to one that has multiplied in size and is now respected throughout the state of Florida. In addition to heading up this leading IPA, he has started a healthcare HMO, an ACO, and created one of the best healthcare corporate infrastructures in the business. Dr. Singh also finds time to be a published poet, philosopher and author. His medical contributions include The Florida Guide to Prescription, Controlled Substance and Pain Medicine Laws (coauthored by Rachel Barlow, Alan Gassman, and Lester Perling), The Essential Planning Guide to 2013 Income & Estate Taxes, and Excerpts From Creditor Protection From Florida Physicians, a Comprehensive Handbook for Physicians and Their Advisors. Add to this the fictional works of Dr. Singh - The Shoreless River, Chutti Ke Din, and his favorite, Riddles for Pesky Teenagers. This is Dr. Singh’s fifth edition of A Primer in Health Care. In addition to publishing books on cutting- edge topics of interest to physicians and administrators, his organization is now a learning organization involving Graduate Medical Education residents.",
    about_book:
      "This book delves deep into the works of Sri Aurobindo to present a compelling and fascinating collage of his multifaceted and multidimensional genius, who is not only one of the greatest political leaders of modern times but a supreme visionary, thinker par excellence, great scholar and writer, spiritual guide and statesman, and a leader of all humanity. The author presents perspectives on his vast oeuvre as a darshanik and shares his exalted dream and aspiration for India and humanity, his horizonless ranges that are their own skylines, his lights, and his snow-capped peaks. It gives a glimpse into Sri Aurobindo’s pragmatic integral philosophy that is unique in being Vedantic in essence yet modern in expression and outlook.",

      "You know, Jasbir, I think we are the only father-son duo in the unit’s history to have been both decorated for gallantry! Also, there is so much of the unit’s history that needs to be properly probed and recorded. It is your time now, and you must do it.” ‘Fighting Fourth’ or 4th Battalion, The Kumaon Regiment (4 Kumaon), raised in 1788, has fought with distinction and etched its name in the annals of Indian military history with honour and pride. From ﬁghting the Pindaris to quelling the Boxer Rebellion in Hong Kong, the battalion saw extensive action in both the World Wars and the Indo-Pak war of 1947–48, where the gallant actions of the unit saved Kashmir Valley for the Indian Union and changed the course of history in the region. Major Somnath Sharma was posthumously awarded India’s ﬁrst Param Vir Chakra, the highest award for gallantry, while Brigadier Pritam Singh emerged as the Saviour of Poonch. The unit was awarded Battle Honour ‘Srinagar’ and 57 awards for bravery, including one Param Vir Chakra, three Maha Vir Chakras, 13 Vir Chakras, one Bar to Vir Chakra and other awards. In the Indo–Pak War 1965, the battalion was awarded Battle Honour ‘Sanjoi–Mirpur’, while in the 1971 operations, it was awarded Battle Honour ‘Shamshernagar’, along with three Vir Ckakras, one SM and other awards. In this book, Brigadier Jasbir presents an intimate, personal account of the glorious history of this ﬁne battalion that has contributed no less than two Chiefs of Staff of the Indian Army and is among the most highly-decorated ones. Brigadier Jasbir Singh, SM, is a Rimcollian who studied at RIMC from 1962 to 1966. Thereafter, he underwent training at NDA Khadakwasla, followed by IMA Dehradun, where he was commissioned in the 4th Battalion, The Kumaon Regiment, or 4 Kumaon (Fighting Fourth).

      "Jinan believes, the cognitive right as the most fundamental right which modernity—society and school—brutally takes away right from childhood. He considers himself to be someone who was able to recover from the damage of schooling and modernity when he got an opportunity to be with indigenous people. His experience with the illiterate artisans helped him to understand the process of creation of life-sustaining knowledge, its holistic nature and also how children learn autonomously. He is engaged in an ongoing research on the true nature of learning—why, what and how. He has been working on natural learning, children and cognitive damages inflicted by Modernity and Modern Schooling for almost three decades now. Currently, Jinan is involved in enabling people to explore and experientially recover their natural cognitive system damaged by schooling.

    about_book:
      "Seeing with Hands is a result of a unique experiment and extensive research by the author, Jinan K.B., and his foundation. It is a record of how children express their experiences through drawing (not art) and how drawing becomes a tool that helps them observe the world around them. Showcasing brilliant drawings made by children to express themselves, the book attempts to prove that they are naturally equipped to adapt and learn autonomously. This book is bound to prompt a new way of thinking on educating children, helping them develop their cognitive tools and provide insights to all those who are concerned with children, be it parents, teachers or caretakers.",

      "Pariksith Singh, MD, is a practicing physician of 30 years. Board Certified in Internal Medicine, he believes unsettling changes in the healthcare industry can also be transformative. “For me it is a time for remarkable opportunity, growth, and innovation,” he says. “I can look back at what I have accomplished, but also look forward in eager anticipation at what is possible.” Dr. Singh watched his organization, Access Health Care Physicians, LLC, grow from a simple, multi-service provider in 2001 to one that has multiplied in size and is now respected throughout the state of Florida. In addition to heading up this leading IPA, he has started a healthcare HMO, an ACO, and created one of the best healthcare corporate infrastructures in the business. Dr. Singh also finds time to be a published poet, philosopher and author. His medical contributions include The Florida Guide to Prescription, Controlled Substance and Pain Medicine Laws (coauthored by Rachel Barlow, Alan Gassman, and Lester Perling), The Essential Planning Guide to 2013 Income & Estate Taxes, and Excerpts From Creditor Protection From Florida Physicians, a Comprehensive Handbook for Physicians and Their Advisors. Add to this the fictional works of Dr. Singh - The Shoreless River, Chutti Ke Din, and his favorite, Riddles for Pesky Teenagers. This is Dr. Singh’s fifth edition of A Primer in Health Care. In addition to publishing books on cutting- edge topics of interest to physicians and administrators, his organization is now a learning organization involving Graduate Medical Education residents.",

      "This book is a significant addition to the growing body of literature on Sri Aurobindo. Dr. Singh delves deep into the works of Sri Aurobindo to present a compelling and fascinating collage of the philosopher’s multifaceted and multidimensional genius: Sri Aurobindo as seer and mystic, as visionary and poet, as writer, translator, linguist and critic, and as India’s first spiritual nationalist. Sri Aurobindo, as this book declares, a true fountainhead of India’s literary renaissance, needs to be discovered and better appreciated not just in India, but globally, and Dr Singh has given an incredible tribute to the saint with this exceptional book.",

    about_book:
      "Snakes in the Ganga unveils uncomfortable truths concerning India’s vulnerabilities: Intense warfare against India’s integrity is the work of a wellorchestrated global machinery driven by a new ideology. Marxism has been reincarnated as critical race theory in US academia and serves as the framework to address America’s racism. This has been recklessly mapped on to India: Caste is equated with Race. Marginalized communities of India are considered as Blacks and Brahmins as the Whites of India. Groups claiming grievances (like Muslims and LGBTQ+) are artificially clubbed together. Popularly called the woke movement, the mission is to dismantle Indian civilization and heritage by waging an uncompromising war against India’s government, educational institutions, culture, industry, and society. Harvard University is ground zero of these social theories developed in collaboration with Indian scholars, activists, journalists, and artists. This represents a clear and present danger to India’s sovereignty and national security. Several Indian elites are hoisting Harvard as the vishwa guru with their money and family names. Some private universities within India are importing wokeism that has serious repercussions for India’s stability. Indian corporates are bringing the latest Western rubric of environmental, social, and governance ratings into their workplaces. This is aligned with the global social justice movement. China has exploited this latest infrastructure as a passage to India. Wokeism has penetrated some of the Indian government’s policies. For instance, the National Education Policy 2020 is propagating Harvard’s liberal arts. An entire ecosystem of ideologies, institutions, and young leaders is emerging for the recolonization of India. Is India for sale? In this paperback edition, the back matter has been trimmed to shed some weight in the interest of portability. Readers can, however, still access it by scanning the QR code printed after the last chapter.",

      "Ankush Sam Thorpe grew up in Punjab, a northern province in India in the 90s. A graduate in Anthropology and a postgraduate in Genetics, his fascination for science began early in life. In his early teens, he was obsessed with 90s Hollywood science fiction films, especially The Terminator and Jurassic Park. His love affair with science fiction began with the Sidney Sheldon novel The Doomsday Conspiracy and solidified with Dan Brown’s The Lost Symbol and George Orwell’s 1984. However, his passion for storytelling grew with Isaac Asimov’s short story Nightfall, which inspired him to create his own tales. In 2011, at the age of twenty, Ankush wrote his first short story, ‘A Stitch in Time’, exhibiting his fascination with science and history. During the Covid pandemic he found the time to create characters, dialogues, and storylines based on the scientific concepts that keep him enthralled to this date. Presently living in the city of Toronto, he continues to pen more stories with science as the central theme. In addition, he is an Instagram junkie as well as a die-hard Test Cricket fan.",

      "We speak often of the Hindu religion, of the Sanatan Dharma, but few of us really know what that religion is...This is the Dharma that for the salvation of humanity was cherished in the seclusion of this peninsula from of old. It is to give this religion that India is rising. She does not rise as other countries do, for self or when she is strong, to trample on the weak. She is rising to shed the eternal light entrusted to her over the world. India has always existed for humanity and not for herself and it is for humanity and not for herself that she must be great”. These are the words of Maharshi Sri Aurobindo. But what is this, Sanatan Dharma? Is it just the religion and rituals that Hindus follow or is it really the secret of Life and Consciousness that is embedded in the very fabric of our cosmic existence? This book reveals the inner layers of Sanatan Dharma and is meant for everyone interested in the truths of our human existence in this vast and endless universe. It is a book that will surely put to rest the myths and misunderstandings about Sanatan Dharma as a religion and a philosophy",

      "Pariksith Singh, MD, is a practicing physician of 30 years. Board Certified in Internal Medicine, he believes unsettling changes in the healthcare industry can also be transformative. “For me it is a time for remarkable opportunity, growth, and innovation,” he says. “I can look back at what I have accomplished, but also look forward in eager anticipation at what is possible.” Dr. Singh watched his organization, Access Health Care Physicians, LLC, grow from a simple, multi-service provider in 2001 to one that has multiplied in size and is now respected throughout the state of Florida. In addition to heading up this leading IPA, he has started a healthcare HMO, an ACO, and created one of the best healthcare corporate infrastructures in the business. Dr. Singh also finds time to be a published poet, philosopher and author. His medical contributions include The Florida Guide to Prescription, Controlled Substance and Pain Medicine Laws (coauthored by Rachel Barlow, Alan Gassman, and Lester Perling), The Essential Planning Guide to 2013 Income & Estate Taxes, and Excerpts From Creditor Protection From Florida Physicians, a Comprehensive Handbook for Physicians and Their Advisors. Add to this the fictional works of Dr. Singh - The Shoreless River, Chutti Ke Din, and his favorite, Riddles for Pesky Teenagers. This is Dr. Singh’s fifth edition of A Primer in Health Care. In addition to publishing books on cutting- edge topics of interest to physicians and administrators, his organization is now a learning organization involving Graduate Medical Education residents.",

      "A Magisterial work by Neelakandan to understand what Hindutva actually is and stands for.' - Dr. Vikram Sampath 'I have long admired Aravindan Neelakandan as one of the very few Indian thinkers who appreciate and acknowledge Western-derived science and modernity, while simultaneously remaining authentically grounded in Hindu tradition. There have been many books on the history of Hinduism and Hindutva, but this one is different, and significant, because it (correctly) takes a step back and identifies that our current situation is part of a global bio-psycho-sociological churn, something playing out over millennia, far beyond the lifespans of any one individual or organization or state. Aravindan, at his core, is a nature-lover and a scientist, and it is this perspective that suffuses this book and makes it special. While there is plenty of ground-breaking content within this expansive, encyclopedic book, I believe the sections on the neurobiological connections of Hindu meditative and ritual practice, which tie the history of Hinduism to the broader evolutionary inheritance of the human species, are going to be very impactful in the years to come.' - Dr Anand Venkatraman Neuroscientist",

It offers a unique perspective for Young India, as the author is a military history writer with vast exposure to various parts of the subcontinent. The book's brutal honesty and its cinematic unfolding of events will captivate the reader. The author was raised in an Army family and had a formative childhood shaped by his mother and schooling at St. Joseph's Academy and Doon School. He later graduated from Madras Christian College and worked with Tiger Tops Mountain Travel before becoming a journalist, filmmaker, and writer. He has produced classic films and authored books, including the Northeast Trilogy and two books about wars. Currently working on a Value Education Program for schools to bring India to Indians.",
    about_book:
      "The book is a Force 12 hurricane, dropping only to a 10 gale now and then, for it sweeps one along breathlessly from incident to incident, place to place, name to name. From the arresting prologue itself, the book is brutally honest, exhilarating and even self-deprecating. It is a story that most of Young India must read, for it provides an incredible ring-side view to critical events in the 1980s and 90s that shaped the destiny of the nation. The author’s subsequent credentials as a military history writer, his earlier works and his vast exposure to virtually every part of the subcontinent, place him in a unique position to paint scenario after scenario where the reader is completely mesmerised by the cinematic unfolding of events. Which genre does this book fit into? This autobiography, however, doesn’t depend on his earlier works for its literary place: it is sui generis, defiant of classification. The nearest one can come to is to call it a thriller in the garb of a life story in the first person - for it is Shiv Kunal’s life story. And it reads like a thriller because it is incredible; the more so, because it is wholly true. His being the son of a distinguished general from a famous regiment may have helped, but not all army brats, however exalted, have this devil’s own luck. It is the kind of life most only dream of, and very few (if any) have the good fortune to live and write about.",

      "Nitya is haunted by the pronouncement that he has “forgotten to live.” He leaves Suvastu, his childhood home, and the obsessive, matriarchal world of the Ammalkans to embark on journeys that will bring him in contact with the mercurial Umi whose life is vitalized by a strange discovery; Purusha, the revolutionary, who believes self-awareness must always be translated into action; the eccentric Govi who dreams of the red clouds of Jupiter; Aniyathi, whose attempt to build a life of her own is overtaken by violence and grief; and, most crucially of all, Chinma, the charismatic “guru” who seeks siddhis or psychic powers. A world of mango and biryani lovers, ghosts and philosophers, music and theyyams and calamitous natural disasters. A world full of stories about the secret worlds we inhabit. Stories that happened a long time ago and will most certainly happen again. Told from multiple perspectives and weaving past and present, dreams and reality, All Stray Dogs Go to Heaven is an astounding debut novel by Krishna Candeth. This unforgettable story explores the power of love, friendship, family, and the elusive idea of home, and compels us to revisit our own ideas of truth, the self and reality.",

      "Brigadier B.S. Mehta comes from an illustrious military family, with four brothers having fought in the War of 1971. Commissioned into 45 CAVALRY in 1966, he later raised the 13 Armoured Regiment. He has served in all the Strike Corps and also an Infantry and Mountain Division with distinction. He has worked on deputation with the Cabinet Secretariat. He took premature retirement in 1998 to serve as Director with the Government of Gujarat. He ran the first course for retiring defence personnel at the Entrepreneurship Development Institute, Ahmedabad in 2000, which became the forerunner for similar courses run by Indian Institutes of Management. He spent the next 16 years in Higher Education to finally demit as Vice Chancellor of Maharishi University of Management and Technology in 2016. Post retirement, he works as an advisor to Gujarat-based NGOs helping families and dependents of martyrs.",
    about_book:
      "Raising a regiment is like riding bareback. The struggle is harder; the sweat, toil and tears unending. The reward is confidence in our own abilities, an understanding and respect for the esprit de corps of the cavalry, and regimental pride.’ From the annals of Indian military history comes the glorious tale of the raising of 13 Armoured Regiment — India’s only armoured regiment raised with a unique class composition of Sikh, Rajput and South Indian Classes. Brigadier Balram Singh Mehta, a veteran of the 1971 war, was reverted from RAW by General A.S. Vaidya, then Chief of Army Staff, to raise 13 AR. The regiment was raised in December 1984, in the aftermath of Operation Blue Star, a time of national turmoil and security concerns in India. Through an engaging narrative, this book weaves together the many personal and professional challenges undertaken by the unit’s officers and its first commandant, Brigadier B.S. Mehta, for the unit to be declared fit for war and assigned to an infantry division. In January 1987 while two of its squadrons participated in the Republic Day Parade at New Delhi and Allahabad, 13 AR was mobilized at short notice and inducted into a Strike RAPID Formation deployed in the desert for Exercise Brasstacks under General Hanut Singh. Pakistan’s nervous response led to President Zia-ul-Haq deploying his Army Reserves opposite Punjab, creating a warlike situation that led to a moment of truth for the leadership in politics, diplomacy and the armed forces of both nations.",

      "This book is part of a series that started with the flagship Snakes in the Ganga: Breaking India 2.0 in September 2022. The present volume focuses on the American project led by Harvard University to dismantle the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and other institutions of excellence in India, by claiming that they propagate structural casteism. While it is beyond the scope of this book to discuss in detail Marxism, Postmodernism and other European intellectual movements of the last 150 years, the fact is that these movements have influenced what has culminated in this current battle against the IITs. Simply put, we will show that: The IITs are under attack. There are legal implications of this attack. It has severe consequences for the IITs, its students and faculty, India, and engineering education. The consequences of this attack will follow the IIT engineer and other tech professionals to their workplace anywhere in the world. Harvard’s Woke machinery is behind this attack and we need to understand the sophistication that backs it. Our evidence-based rebuttal gives IITians and other engineers the toolkit to tackle false accusations of being casteist bigots. We end with a call to action by IITians and other stakeholders.",

    about_book:
      "Evocatively titled, Of Newtons and Apples: Insights into 50 Great Minds in Human History does exactly what it promises. It gives us a glimpse into the professional and personal lives of 50 great personalities whose names, in some cases, are a part of everyday conversation, while in others, they are familiar names about whom we know little. Just the way the falling of an apple led to major discoveries by Newton, this work tries to identify sources of the genius of the personalities across human history. These men and women were either creators or those who redefined the course of history in their field of work. Interestingly, each article focuses on a major achievement and one aspect of their personal lives. Such sharpness makes the articles short, engaging and, in many cases, poetic. The classification of personalities into Building, Doing and Thinking gives us new eyes to look at them once again and debate within ourselves, the fuzzy boundaries that exist between these three primary human activities.",

      "The author, Bimal Chakravartty, was born in Kashi, where he spent his adolescent years. However, since his father was with the Indian Railways, he has lived in many parts of India as well. He lost his father at a very young age, and thus, his career took up a greater part of his youth. He never gave up what he liked, though - reading. Reading books written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Rabindra Nath Tagore, Bibutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, and others has always fascinated and intrigued him. Currently, he resides in Noida, where he spends time both reading classics and writing some himself as well. He is, what many would say, a probashi Bengali - one who is not from Kolkata. But, his command over the language and his expressions and thoughts are all very much a reflection of the 'City of Joy'. Probashir Golpo Shongroho, his second book, the first being his autobiography, Jana Awjanar Majhe, is as, if not more, poetic, soulful, and warm as his first novel was.",
    about_book:
      "When suave writing is interwoven with simplicity, then we get a book like Probashir Golpo Shongroho. A collection of 21 stories from the author of the much-appreciated autobiography, Jana Awjanar Majhe, they peek into the author’s life, his thoughts, and his soul. The stories are layered beauties – how else would you explain a horror story speaking of ‘sorry is still so tough to say’ or the tale of how the author had gotten saved from many neardeath experiences talking subtly about ‘when the Lord protects us, we can defy death’. Each story is not more than three to four pages long, but the music that he plays with the words, moving from one note to another, surprising the reader with the unexpected, shows the deftness of the author’s writing skills. He might be a fan of the stalwarts of Bengali literature, but he, himself, is definitely one too.",

      "Embedded within the primary narrative of the Mahabharata lie numerous sub-tales known as upakhyaanas or upakathas. These lesser known stories play a vital role in completing the grand tapestry of the Mahabharata, thus giving this book its apt title. Unlike verse translations found in unabridged versions, the 67 upakathas presented here serve a different purpose. While they may appear as diversions, these narratives serve as vital threads, connecting the text and offering answers to lingering questions that readers may have. For instance, why did Ambaa, the princess of Kaashi, become the catalyst for Bheeshma’s demise in a later life? The Ambaa upakhyaana holds the answers. Similarly, the stories of Sage Parashuraama reveal why a brahmana like him possessed warrior-like qualities. Two upakhyaanas shed light on this enigma. Additionally, the Yayaati upakhyaana elucidates the reasons behind the Kurus descending from Puru, Yayaati’s youngest son, rather than the eldest. Moreover, the intriguing dialogue between Duryodhana and Shalya, where Duryodhana persuades Shalya to become Karna’s charioteer, is also explored in these Upakathas.",

    about_book:
      "To those who claim we are now living in a totalitarian, fascist, Hindu Rashtra, one must ask: What kind of a Hindu Rashtra is this where a billion-strong Hindus have been, through our parliament, through our courts, our education system, and our constitution, reduced to not just second-class but, rather, eighth-class citizens? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where Ram Navami, Hanuman Jayanti, Durga pooja processions, and even Garba celebrations, are attacked and stoned with impunity? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where a sitting Prime minister says minorities have the first right to resources? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where Hindus are forced to be refugees in their own land, where one can settle 40,000 Rohingya Muslims but not 700,000 Kashmiri Hindus, the land’s original inhabitants; where the judiciary says it is too late to prosecute those who raped, murdered, and ethnically cleansed lacs of Hindus? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where Hindu temples are exclusively controlled by the State, where Hindus must beg for Waqf land to celebrate their festival while the government usurps hundreds of thousands of acres of temple land and is responsible for more than 100,000 temples losing lakhs of crores in rental income? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where the Right to Education Act discriminates only against Hindus and their schools, forcing tens of thousands of them to shut down? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where monsters like Aurangzeb and Tipu who perpetrated large-scale Hindu genocides are eulogised through State sponsored publications, naming of roads and cities, and organising of festivals? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where a law was about to be enacted through with only the Hindus would have been held guilty in a communal riot even if they were in a minority for example in Kashmir? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where court judgments like the Sabarimala and legislative enactments like the Hindu Code Bill purport to reform only Hindu religious practices but dare not touch practices of other religions, and if they do, the decisions are promptly reversed like in the Shah Bano case? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where The Places of Worship Act continues to deny the Hindus their legitimate right to correct historical injustices and reclaim thousands of demolished temples? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where the Waqf Act gives overarching powers to Muslims to declare a 1500-year-old Hindu temple to be on Islamic land when Islam is only 1300 years old? If this is how a Hindu is rewarded in a Hindu Rashtra, he’d much rather be in a Muslim Rashtra because then at least there’d be no pretence of equality - a Kafir will get what he deserves. In this searing commentary penned with clinical precision, the author shreds to smithereens once and for all the guilt-tripping, self-loathing fake narrative that Hindus have been duped with since Independence. There is no pretence, no political correctness, only unvarnished truth – that the Hindus are living under State-sanctioned Apartheid.",

    about_book:
      "When QUTUB-UD-DIN AIBAK died in a polo game 1210, he had left behind a rickety, fledgling Muslim kingdom in Delhi. For the next eighty-odd years, its fortunes swayed wildly, witnessing a record twelve kings. It was a period of incessant palace coups and serial political murders. The death of Balban extinguishes the so-called Muslim Slave dynasty and with it ends the short-lived Turkic Muslim imperialism. It also heralds the ascent of the Afghanistan-based Khaljis, classed as “low-born.” A straight line connects the origin of the Khaljis with the military airport built by the US in Zabul in 2006. By this time, Hindu political power in northern India is in total disarray with no unifying leader who has the vision to combat and expel the alien oppressor lodged in Delhi. No Hindu ruler exploits the repeated openings and vulnerabilities provided by internecine Sultanate warfare. Book 2 of Invaders and Infidels traces the unlikely rise of Jalal-ud-din Khalji as an ill-suited monarch and ends with the maiden Islamic raid of Devagiri, the gateway to southern India. The incident will have far-reaching consequences for the history of India for the next six hundred years. It is a heady tale of a period rife with bloody intrigues, aggressive campaigns of Islamic expansionism, heroic wars of Hindu resistance and squandered chances for civilizational reclamation. The narrative in this book is marked by a flair of vivid historical storytelling, juxtaposing the oscillating fortunes of both Islamic conquests and the ensuing Hindu responses. It unearths a slew of eye-opening and forgotten details about the socio-political and economic life of the era whose impact is visible even today. Written in a fast-paced and engaging style, Book 2 of Invaders and Infidels is a riveting read of a critical juncture in the history of early Muslim rule of India.",

At 26, he left for Pondicherry, where he remained for several years.",
    about_book:
      "Little known in his own country, Sri Aurobindo was nevertheless one of the more significant personalities of 20th-century India. After studying Humanities in England, he embarked on a political struggle to challenge Britain's colonial domination over India. In 1906, he founded the newspaper Bande Mataram, laying the groundwork of India's future independence, notably through passive resistance, which was later adopted by Gandhi. But far from Gandhi's pacifism, Sri Aurobindo was convinced that freedom could only be achieved via action, and even via armed struggle. Absorbed by India's century-old wisdom, his commitment to his country was doubled by an unremitting inner spiritual quest. In 1910, Sri Aurobindo began another life in Pondicherry. In his written works, notably The Life Divine, published in 1920, he propounded an Integral Yoga describing the conditions of the The Great Passage, meant to lead to the next evolution of mankind. His work influenced and attracted disciples from around the world to his Ashram, founded in 1926, with his companion Mirra Alfassa, and later to the Auroville community, a few kilometres from Pondicherry. Through this biography, Luc Venet reveals the unfolding of Sri Aurobindo's exceptional force and opens up the path to a new evolution of humanity",

That the author does this in the light of Sri Aurobindo—inarguably among the very few who realised and lived the deepest and highest Vedic truths in their beings—makes it even more significant. This book comes at the right time too, as Indians globally begin to reawaken to their timeless Vedic and Sanatan heritage.",

    about_book:
      "India and the Changing World breaks free from conventional boundaries, delving fearlessly into the realms of emerging civilizational, religious, and historical matters. Its purpose lies in sparking essential conversations about broader matters, such as civilizational, cultural, and social diversity issues that have been overlooked in the shaping of the post-World War II and post-Cold War global order. As the existing global order confronts unprecedented challenges, this book serves as a catalyst, fueling a discourse that captures the essence of a rapidly evolving world. Through a comparative study, the book offers fresh insights into the contrasting approaches of short-termist liberal democracies and long-termist autocratic China, shedding light on the distinctive qualities of a liberal and civilizational democracy as exemplified by India. Within its illuminating pages, you will uncover the critical challenges that Indian democracy faces, navigating the complexities of its relationship with both autocratic China and the liberal West. Additionally, the book examines the fundamental differences between market economics and market societies. It artfully unravels contemporary geopolitical, geo-economic, and geostrategic issues, offering intricate analysis of India's strategic connections with select nations and its ever-growing ties with the USA. Moreover, it dares to propose innovative solutions like astronomy-based education as a means to foster conflict resolution. With an invitation that resonates deeply, India and the Changing World Order calls upon you to partake in a discourse that reevaluates the past, contextualises the present, and ultimately shapes the trajectory of our shared future.",

      "Theyyam, an ancient tradition of North Malabar, is a captivating blend of folk art, religious ritual, and profound spirituality. Gods Dancing among Men: The Mystical World of Theyyams of North Malabar delves deep into the rich history of theyyam, exploring its roots and relevance in contemporary belief and worship. This book sheds light on both the luminous and shadowy facets of this tradition as well as the enigmatic grey areas that define it. Every aspect of the theyyam cult, from the vibrant and intricate costumes to the wild and transcendent dances, is fascinating. The practitioners of theyyam display astonishing abilities, including clairvoyance, prophecy, and the power to fulfil wishes. The pantheon of theyyam includes Shaivite and Vaishnavite manifestations alongside a diverse array of Bhagvathy theyyams. Popular deities such as Muthappan, Muchilot Bhagavathi, Thee Chamundi, Gulikan, Kuttichathan, and Pottan Deiyvam hold a special place in the hearts of the people. Additionally, the theyyam tradition incorporates animals into its repertoire with performances featuring monkeys, tigers, buffaloes, crocodiles, bees, and snakes. One of the most astonishing aspects of theyyam is the fearless interaction with fire. Performers nonchalantly walk on embers and even hurl themselves onto immense mounds of fire, known as meleri, repeatedly. Despite the influence of Aryanization, the sanitizing impact of British colonial rule, the teachings of social reformers, the remarkable literacy rates, and the prevalent communist ideology in the region, the sanctity of the theyyam tradition remains unblemished. Theyyams are living gods, cherished and revered by the people of North Malabar, and their blessings hold immense significance.",

    about_book:
      "Governance is a 360-degree process; this book is an arc. New India dawned on 26 May 2014 when the Union government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi was sworn in by the president of the Republic of India. Its governance agenda was unveiled by the president in Parliament on 9 June 2014 with this stentorian statement: My government is dedicated to the poor…. With a firm belief that the first claim on development belongs to the poor, my government pledges itself to the principle of sabke saath, sabka vikas…. My government will function on the mantra of minimum government, maximum governance, and we will work together to re-establish the credibility of the institutions of democracy. The government got a second mandate in 2019. This book, which is a compilation of the authors articles and papers, will take the reader through different dimensions of governance, government, institutions, democracy and development critically, analysing the flavour of New India in them.",

      "To those who claim we are now living in a totalitarian, fascist, Hindu Rashtra, one must ask: What kind of a Hindu Rashtra is this where a billion-strong Hindus have been, through our parliament, through our courts, our education system, and our constitution, reduced to not just second-class but, rather, eighth-class citizens? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where Ram Navami, Hanuman Jayanti, Durga pooja processions, and even Garba celebrations, are attacked and stoned with impunity? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where a sitting Prime minister says minorities have the first right to resources? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where Hindus are forced to be refugees in their own land, where one can settle 40,000 Rohingya Muslims but not 700,000 Kashmiri Hindus, the land’s original inhabitants; where the judiciary says it is too late to prosecute those who raped, murdered, and ethnically cleansed lacs of Hindus? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where Hindu temples are exclusively controlled by the State, where Hindus must beg for Waqf land to celebrate their festival while the government usurps hundreds of thousands of acres of temple land and is responsible for more than 100,000 temples losing lakhs of crores in rental income? … If this is how a Hindu is rewarded in a Hindu Rashtra, he’d much rather be in a Muslim Rashtra because then at least there’d be no pretence of equality - a Kafir will get what he deserves. In this searing commentary penned with clinical precision, the author shreds to smithereens once and for all the guilt-tripping, self-loathing fake narrative that Hindus have been duped with since Independence. There is no pretence, no political correctness, only unvarnished truth – that the Hindus are living under State-sanctioned Apartheid. About The Author- Anand Ranganathan is a scientist and an author. His forthcoming book is on Indias forgotten scientists. Hindus in Hindu Rashtra is his first non-fiction book.",

    about_book:
      "A civilization that forgets its struggles is condemned to repeat its mistakes and spiral into a self-destructive cycle. The battles for freedom and the resistance against occupation and atrocities all too often recede from collective memory, overshadowed by the weight of oppression and systematically orchestrated efforts to erase the Hindu identity through manipulated narratives. The sacred geography of Bharat, the cradle of Hindu dharma and the ancestral home of the Hindu people, has borne witness to relentless invasions, leaving scars on the collective psyche. The Ram Janmabhoomi movement stands as a poignant testament to the devastation inflicted upon the roots of Hindu civilization and the arduous battle to reclaim it. In an era dominated by weaponized narratives, where the perpetrators of atrocities are romanticised as victims and the victims are crowned as oppressors, this book reminds of the facts and the inconvenient truths—of the blood, sweat and tears that many Hindus shed in fighting the good fight. It is a call to ensure that every Hindu born in an age, removed from those trials and tribulations, never forgets the sacrifices made by those who went before them. For if we forget, we are complicit in normalising the obliteration of our great civilization.",

      "Few places in the world carry the heavy burden of history as effortlessly as Kashi, or Varanasi, has. The holy city embodies the very soul of our civilization and personifies the resilience that we have displayed over centuries in the face of numerous adversities and fatal attacks. Waiting for Shiva: Unearthing the Truth of Kashi’s Gyan Vapi recreates the history, antiquity and sanctity of Kashi as the abode of Bhagwan Shiva in the form of Vishweshwara, or Vishwanath. Shiva himself assured his devotees of salvation if they leave their mortal coils in the city. The book delves into the history of this selfmanifested swayambhu jyotirlinga shrine of Vishweshwara, which for centuries has been both a refuge for the devout and a target of the bloodiest waves of iconoclasm. However, each time an attempt was made to obliterate the temple by demolishing it, it managed to rise and prosper. Every iconoclastic storm was followed by an episode of persistence, tenacity and stubborn resolve. Shrines fell and shrines rose, but the Hindus of Kashi never gave up—not even once. Waiting for Shiva documents these cataclysmic events in the temple’s history. The final death blow was dealt in 1669 by the Mughal despot Aurangzeb, who demolished the temple and erected few domes on the partially destroyed western wall to call it a mosque. The temple complex was desecrated and left strewn with ruins as a grim reminder of the humiliation and insult that Hindus had to face as a consequence of their holiest shrine being torn down to smithereens. The area that is now called the Gyan Vapi mosque and the surrounding land that lies adjacent to the new temple of Vishwanath, which came up towards the end of the 18th Century, has always been one of intense contestation. Bloody riots overran Varanasi over this issue multiple times in the past. During the colonial era, the doors of the British courts were knocked at to settle the occupancy issue, and they adjudicated the matter several times. PostIndependence, too, the desire to ‘liberate’ the complex has been seething in the Hindu imagination. A new suit filed in 2021 before the Varanasi civil court reopened a longfestering historical wound. Despite several appeals right up to the Supreme Court to dismiss the plaint, a survey by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) was ordered, which would lay bare the truth in its findings by the end of 2023. Vikram Sampath’s latest offering retraces the long history of this bitterly disputed site and the dramatic twists and turns in the checkered past of this hoary shrine. Piecing together numerous documents and accounts—Vedic and Puranic texts, Sanskrit literary sources, Agama shastras, Jataka tales, Persian accounts, travelogues of foreigners, archival records and copious legal documents detailing the contestation from the British era to modern Indian courts—the book recreates, for the first time with facts and cogent arguments, this stormy history right up to the present times. The longsuppressed secrets that lay hidden in Gyan Vapi finally finds a voice through this book.",

      "Snakes in the Ganga unveils uncomfortable truths concerning India’s vulnerabilities: Intense warfare against India’s integrity is the work of a wellorchestrated global machinery driven by a new ideology. Marxism has been reincarnated as critical race theory in US academia and serves as the framework to address America’s racism. This has been recklessly mapped on to India: Caste is equated with Race. Marginalized communities of India are considered as Blacks and Brahmins as the Whites of India. Groups claiming grievances (like Muslims and LGBTQ+) are artificially clubbed together. Popularly called the woke movement, the mission is to dismantle Indian civilization and heritage by waging an uncompromising war against India’s government, educational institutions, culture, industry, and society. Harvard University is ground zero of these social theories developed in collaboration with Indian scholars, activists, journalists, and artists. This represents a clear and present danger to India’s sovereignty and national security. Several Indian elites are hoisting Harvard as the vishwa guru with their money and family names. Some private universities within India are importing wokeism that has serious repercussions for India’s stability. Indian corporates are bringing the latest Western rubric of environmental, social, and governance ratings into their workplaces. This is aligned with the global social justice movement. China has exploited this latest infrastructure as a passage to India. Wokeism has penetrated some of the Indian government’s policies. For instance, the National Education Policy 2020 is propagating Harvard’s liberal arts. An entire ecosystem of ideologies, institutions, and young leaders is emerging for the recolonization of India.
