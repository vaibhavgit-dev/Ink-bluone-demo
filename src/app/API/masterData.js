    AuthorInfo:"Pariksith Singh, MD, is a practicing physician of 30 years. Board Certified in Internal Medicine, he believes unsettling changes in the healthcare industry can also be transformative. “For me it is a time for remarkable opportunity, growth, and innovation,” he says. “I can look back at what I have accomplished, but also look forward in eager anticipation at what is possible.” Dr. Singh watched his organization, Access Health Care Physicians, LLC, grow from a simple, multi-service provider in 2001 to one that has multiplied in size and is now respected throughout the state of Florida. In addition to heading up this leading IPA, he has started a healthcare HMO, an ACO, and created one of the best healthcare corporate infrastructures in the business. Dr. Singh also finds time to be a published poet, philosopher and author. His medical contributions include The Florida Guide to Prescription, Controlled Substance and Pain Medicine Laws (coauthored by Rachel Barlow, Alan Gassman, and Lester Perling), The Essential Planning Guide to 2013 Income & Estate Taxes, and Excerpts From Creditor Protection From Florida Physicians, a Comprehensive Handbook for Physicians and Their Advisors. Add to this the fictional works of Dr. Singh - The Shoreless River, Chutti Ke Din, and his favorite, Riddles for Pesky Teenagers. This is Dr. Singh’s fifth edition of A Primer in Health Care. In addition to publishing books on cutting- edge topics of interest to physicians and administrators, his organization is now a learning organization involving Graduate Medical Education residents.",
    about_book:"This book delves deep into the works of Sri Aurobindo to present a compelling and fascinating collage of his multifaceted and multidimensional genius, who is not only one of the greatest political leaders of modern times but a supreme visionary, thinker par excellence, great scholar and writer, spiritual guide and statesman, and a leader of all humanity. The author presents perspectives on his vast oeuvre as a darshanik and shares his exalted dream and aspiration for India and humanity, his horizonless ranges that are their own skylines, his lights, and his snow-capped peaks. It gives a glimpse into Sri Aurobindo’s pragmatic integral philosophy that is unique in being Vedantic in essence yet modern in expression and outlook.",

    about_book:"You know, Jasbir, I think we are the only father-son duo in the unit’s history to have been both decorated for gallantry! Also, there is so much of the unit’s history that needs to be properly probed and recorded. It is your time now, and you must do it.” ‘Fighting Fourth’ or 4th Battalion, The Kumaon Regiment (4 Kumaon), raised in 1788, has fought with distinction and etched its name in the annals of Indian military history with honour and pride. From ﬁghting the Pindaris to quelling the Boxer Rebellion in Hong Kong, the battalion saw extensive action in both the World Wars and the Indo-Pak war of 1947–48, where the gallant actions of the unit saved Kashmir Valley for the Indian Union and changed the course of history in the region. Major Somnath Sharma was posthumously awarded India’s ﬁrst Param Vir Chakra, the highest award for gallantry, while Brigadier Pritam Singh emerged as the Saviour of Poonch. The unit was awarded Battle Honour ‘Srinagar’ and 57 awards for bravery, including one Param Vir Chakra, three Maha Vir Chakras, 13 Vir Chakras, one Bar to Vir Chakra and other awards. In the Indo–Pak War 1965, the battalion was awarded Battle Honour ‘Sanjoi–Mirpur’, while in the 1971 operations, it was awarded Battle Honour ‘Shamshernagar’, along with three Vir Ckakras, one SM and other awards. In this book, Brigadier Jasbir presents an intimate, personal account of the glorious history of this ﬁne battalion that has contributed no less than two Chiefs of Staff of the Indian Army and is among the most highly-decorated ones. Brigadier Jasbir Singh, SM, is a Rimcollian who studied at RIMC from 1962 to 1966. Thereafter, he underwent training at NDA Khadakwasla, followed by IMA Dehradun, where he was commissioned in the 4th Battalion, The Kumaon Regiment, or 4 Kumaon (Fighting Fourth). He was wounded during operations behind enemy lines in East Pakistan in the 1971 war and decorated twice for gallantry during operations.",

He is engaged in an ongoing research on the true nature of learning—why, what and how. He has been working on natural learning, children and cognitive damages inflicted by Modernity and Modern Schooling for almost three decades now. Currently, Jinan is involved in enabling people to explore and experientially recover their natural cognitive system damaged by schooling.

    AuthorInfo:"Pariksith Singh, MD, is a practicing physician of 30 years. Board Certified in Internal Medicine, he believes unsettling changes in the healthcare industry can also be transformative. “For me it is a time for remarkable opportunity, growth, and innovation,” he says. “I can look back at what I have accomplished, but also look forward in eager anticipation at what is possible.” Dr. Singh watched his organization, Access Health Care Physicians, LLC, grow from a simple, multi-service provider in 2001 to one that has multiplied in size and is now respected throughout the state of Florida. In addition to heading up this leading IPA, he has started a healthcare HMO, an ACO, and created one of the best healthcare corporate infrastructures in the business. Dr. Singh also finds time to be a published poet, philosopher and author.

    about_book:"Snakes in the Ganga unveils uncomfortable truths concerning India’s vulnerabilities: Intense warfare against India’s integrity is the work of a wellorchestrated global machinery driven by a new ideology. Marxism has been reincarnated as critical race theory in US academia and serves as the framework to address America’s racism. This has been recklessly mapped on to India: Caste is equated with Race. Marginalized communities of India are considered as Blacks and Brahmins as the Whites of India. Groups claiming grievances (like Muslims and LGBTQ+) are artificially clubbed together. Popularly called the woke movement, the mission is to dismantle Indian civilization and heritage by waging an uncompromising war against India’s government, educational institutions, culture, industry, and society. Harvard University is ground zero of these social theories developed in collaboration with Indian scholars, activists, journalists, and artists. This represents a clear and present danger to India’s sovereignty and national security. Several Indian elites are hoisting Harvard as the vishwa guru with their money and family names. Some private universities within India are importing wokeism that has serious repercussions for India’s stability. Indian corporates are bringing the latest Western rubric of environmental, social, and governance ratings into their workplaces. This is aligned with the global social justice movement. China has exploited this latest infrastructure as a passage to India. Wokeism has penetrated some of the Indian government’s policies. For instance, the National Education Policy 2020 is propagating Harvard’s liberal arts. An entire ecosystem of ideologies, institutions, and young leaders is emerging for the recolonization of India. Is India for sale? In this paperback edition, the back matter has been trimmed to shed some weight in the interest of portability. Readers can, however, still access it by scanning the QR code printed after the last chapter.",

A graduate in Anthropology and a postgraduate in Genetics, his fascination for science began early in life. In his early teens, he was obsessed with 90s Hollywood science fiction films, especially The Terminator and Jurassic Park. His love affair with science fiction began with the Sidney Sheldon novel The Doomsday Conspiracy and solidified with Dan Brown’s The Lost Symbol and George Orwell’s 1984. However, his passion for storytelling grew with Isaac Asimov’s short story Nightfall, which inspired him to create his own tales. In 2011, at the age of twenty, Ankush wrote his first short story, ‘A Stitch in Time’, exhibiting his fascination with science and history. During the Covid pandemic he found the time to create characters, dialogues, and storylines based on the scientific concepts that keep him enthralled to this date. Presently living in the city of Toronto, he continues to pen more stories with science as the central theme. In addition, he is an Instagram junkie as well as a die-hard Test Cricket fan.",

It is to give this religion that India is rising. She does not rise as other countries do, for self or when she is strong, to trample on the weak. She is rising to shed the eternal light entrusted to her over the world. India has always existed for humanity and not for herself and it is for humanity and not for herself that she must be great”. These are the words of Maharshi Sri Aurobindo. But what is this, Sanatan Dharma? Is it just the religion and rituals that Hindus follow or is it really the secret of Life and Consciousness that is embedded in the very fabric of our cosmic existence? This book reveals the inner layers of Sanatan Dharma and is meant for everyone interested in the truths of our human existence in this vast and endless universe. It is a book that will surely put to rest the myths and misunderstandings about Sanatan Dharma as a religion and a philosophy",

    AuthorInfo:"Pariksith Singh, MD, is a practicing physician of 30 years. Board Certified in Internal Medicine, he believes unsettling changes in the healthcare industry can also be transformative. “For me it is a time for remarkable opportunity, growth, and innovation,” he says. “I can look back at what I have accomplished, but also look forward in eager anticipation at what is possible.” Dr. Singh watched his organization, Access Health Care Physicians, LLC, grow from a simple, multi-service provider in 2001 to one that has multiplied in size and is now respected throughout the state of Florida. In addition to heading up this leading IPA, he has started a healthcare HMO, an ACO, and created one of the best healthcare corporate infrastructures in the business. Dr. Singh also finds time to be a published poet, philosopher and author. His medical contributions include The Florida Guide to Prescription, Controlled Substance and Pain Medicine Laws (coauthored by Rachel Barlow, Alan Gassman, and Lester Perling), The Essential Planning Guide to 2013 Income & Estate Taxes, and Excerpts From Creditor Protection From Florida Physicians, a Comprehensive Handbook for Physicians and Their Advisors. Add to this the fictional works of Dr. Singh - The Shoreless River, Chutti Ke Din, and his favorite, Riddles for Pesky Teenagers. This is Dr. Singh’s fifth edition of A Primer in Health Care. In addition to publishing books on cutting- edge topics of interest to physicians and administrators, his organization is now a learning organization involving Graduate Medical Education residents.",

    about_book:"A Magisterial work by Neelakandan to understand what Hindutva actually is and stands for.' - Dr. Vikram Sampath 'I have long admired Aravindan Neelakandan as one of the very few Indian thinkers who appreciate and acknowledge Western-derived science and modernity, while simultaneously remaining authentically grounded in Hindu tradition. There have been many books on the history of Hinduism and Hindutva, but this one is different, and significant, because it (correctly) takes a step back and identifies that our current situation is part of a global bio-psycho-sociological churn, something playing out over millennia, far beyond the lifespans of any one individual or organization or state. Aravindan, at his core, is a nature-lover and a scientist, and it is this perspective that suffuses this book and makes it special. While there is plenty of ground-breaking content within this expansive, encyclopedic book, I believe the sections on the neurobiological connections of Hindu meditative and ritual practice, which tie the history of Hinduism to the broader evolutionary inheritance of the human species, are going to be very impactful in the years to come.' - Dr Anand Venkatraman Neuroscientist",

It offers a unique perspective for Young India, as the author is a military history writer with vast exposure to various parts of the subcontinent. The book's brutal honesty and its cinematic unfolding of events will captivate the reader. The author was raised in an Army family and had a formative childhood shaped by his mother and schooling at St. Joseph's Academy and Doon School. He later graduated from Madras Christian College and worked with Tiger Tops Mountain Travel before becoming a journalist, filmmaker, and writer. He has produced classic films and authored books, including the Northeast Trilogy and two books about wars. Currently working on a Value Education Program for schools to bring India to Indians.",
    about_book:"The book is a Force 12 hurricane, dropping only to a 10 gale now and then, for it sweeps one along breathlessly from incident to incident, place to place, name to name. From the arresting prologue itself, the book is brutally honest, exhilarating and even self-deprecating. It is a story that most of Young India must read, for it provides an incredible ring-side view to critical events in the 1980s and 90s that shaped the destiny of the nation. The author’s subsequent credentials as a military history writer, his earlier works and his vast exposure to virtually every part of the subcontinent, place him in a unique position to paint scenario after scenario where the reader is completely mesmerised by the cinematic unfolding of events. Which genre does this book fit into? This autobiography, however, doesn’t depend on his earlier works for its literary place: it is sui generis, defiant of classification. The nearest one can come to is to call it a thriller in the garb of a life story in the first person - for it is Shiv Kunal’s life story. And it reads like a thriller because it is incredible; the more so, because it is wholly true. His being the son of a distinguished general from a famous regiment may have helped, but not all army brats, however exalted, have this devil’s own luck. It is the kind of life most only dream of, and very few (if any) have the good fortune to live and write about.",
